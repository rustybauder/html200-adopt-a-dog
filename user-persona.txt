Bio:
Jack Johnson is a married father of two who just made the big jump from renting an apartment to buying a home. Because his previous apartment did not allow pets, he is now searching for a kid-friendly pet. However, as he works full time, he does not have the time to visit multiple shelters to find a pet. As a designer, he spends most of his time on his Macbook, although when commuting, he is usually on his iPad.

Goals:
Find prospective pets easily without having to visit multiple shelters.
Prefer to do the paperwork online.
Quick adoption process.

Pain Points:
