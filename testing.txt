TESTING

I started my testing process by checking my website on different web platforms,
such as Google Chrome, Edge and Firefox. I was not able to test on Mac OS as I do not own a Mac computer. I also tested the webpage on my
iPad and iPhone.

Issues I fixed included:
-Making sure I was using percentages, rems, and ems as much as possible.
-Resizing/adusting some elements to ensure that they displayed properly in different windows.
-Fixing the JQuerey on the dogs page.
-Not really an issue, but I removed unused HTML from the pages.

Pretty much everything else worked well enough.

I did run into several issues that I was not able to fix:
-The first issue requires a bit of context: I started designing this page on an older laptop with a 1080p resolution display.
However, that laptop broke down and I replaced it with a new one with a 4k display. For whatever reason (possibly related to the display
or something else) everything appears zoomed in on my browser. This means some elements are show weirdly unless I zoom out the page to 
80%. I tried figuring out why this is the case, and I think it might be a system setting as it affects all three browsers I tried. I tried
changing my CSS to fix it, but I only managed to make things worse.

-Another issue I couldn't fix was when I change the screen size, the cart icon, cart total, and checkout button all move to different
places in the header. This probably has to do with the way I coded it with CSS, but I was not able to figure it out without making it worse.
